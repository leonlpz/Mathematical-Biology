# Mathematical-Biology
The Mathematical Biology repository presents practical applications of a current rapidly growing area. This repository focuses primarily on situations where continuous models are appropriate, and can be modeled by means of deterministic, ordinary or partial differential equations. Using particular examples of modeling in Ecology, Chemistry, Biology, Physiology and Epidemiology, it is demonstrated how various techniques from applied mathematics and nonlinear dynamics (such as: linear stability, phase planes, singular perturbations and traveling waves) can provide information important on the behavior of complex biological models. Finally, we try to develop a reasonable skill with the mathematical tools most commonly used in this discipline.

In conclusion, it is intended:
- Have the basic notions of mathematical biology.
- Master the basic techniques of nonlinear dynamics and some of the applied mathematics.
- Efficiently handle basic numerical methods for solving algebraic and differential equations, graphing, etc.
- Be able to develop and analyze mathematical models of simple biological systems.
